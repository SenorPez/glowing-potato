Trident consists of tools and support for something vague and pointless. So, really, like most of what you'll find on Github dot com.

## Current Release
**Release 1** is the most current release of Trident and consists of the following components. See below for detailed release notes for each component.

- **API Version 1.0**
- **Clock Version 1.0**
- **Web Version 1.0**

## API
The current version of **API** is **Version 1.0**.

The API provides a HAL-compliant HATEOAS REST application for serving data

The primary reference implementation is located at http://trident.senorpez.com/.
Complete documentation of acceptable headers, HTTP methods, and endpoints is located at http://\<server\>/docs/reference.html.

### Changelog
**Version 1.0**
First release.

## Clock
The current version of **Clock** is **Version 1.0**.

Clock is an Android application that provides a conversion between standard time (UTC) and local 1 Eta Veneris 3 time (STK), and displays it using a local clock format. If none of this makes sense to you, don't worry.

### Changelog
**Version 1.0**
First release.

## Web
The current version of **Web** is **Version 1.0**.

Web is a cobbled-together mess of Javascript and Python scripts that make a poor implementation of several web applications. It's completely untested and probably incredibly unstable, but it compiles so it's now at version 1.0.

### Changelog
**Version 1.0**
First release.
